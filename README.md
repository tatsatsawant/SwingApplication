# Java Swing Application

This is a simple Java Swing application that demonstrates a basic graphical user interface with a switchable dark and light theme. The application consists of a main frame containing different panels, buttons, and labels.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several classes:

- `Main`: The main class containing the `main` method to start the Swing application.
- `AppFrame`: Represents the main frame of the application with panels for content, buttons, and labels. Handles the UI setup and theme switching.
- `ButtonConstructor`: A utility class responsible for creating and configuring buttons with specific themes.
- `PanelConstructor`: Another utility class responsible for creating and configuring panels with specific themes.
- `Theme`: Defines the visual properties of the themes (dark and light) used in the application.
- `ThemeManager`: Manages the available themes (dark and light) and provides access to them.

## Features

- **Dark and Light Themes:** The application supports both dark and light themes, and users can switch between them using a dedicated button.

- **Dynamic Theme Updates:** The UI components are dynamically updated when the theme changes, providing a seamless transition between themes.

- **Hover Effects:** Buttons and panels have hover effects to enhance the user experience.

## Skills Implemented

- **Java Swing:** Utilized Java Swing for building the graphical user interface (GUI) components.

- **Modular Design:** Implemented a modular design by organizing the code into separate classes for better maintainability and readability.

- **Theme Management:** Developed a theme management system allowing users to switch between dark and light themes dynamically.

- **Event Handling:** Employed event listeners to handle button clicks and mouse events for improved user interaction.

- **UI Customization:** Created utility classes (`ButtonConstructor` and `PanelConstructor`) for customizing and updating UI components.
